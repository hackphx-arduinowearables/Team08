What is it?
-----------

Have you ever wanted to send a message to your friends accross a crowded room? How about blast out your opinion to everyone around you without any of them knowing what you're really saying?

Welcome to Morse Code Earrings, the hip new device that takes you from boring to fabulous.

Some assembly required.

The Morse code earrings work by receiving an ASCII message via bluetooth low energy (BLE). Once your phone or other device is paired with the earrings, simply send an ASCII message of your choosing and watch as the earrings illuminate to send out your message to the world!
